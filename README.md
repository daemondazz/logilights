# Logibone RGB Matrix Driver

This project is an extension of Glen Atkins' "beagle" project (https://github.com/bikerglen/beagle/). The FPGA code is essentially forked from Glen's code, although I have renamed it from "beagle" to "logilights", cleaned it up a bit and also made a few changes (such as to drive 3 panels).

The software to run on the Beaglebone Black has been ported to Python and the example programs demonstrate using the Python FreeType bindings to render text to the panel on the fly.
